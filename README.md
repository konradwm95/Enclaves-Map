# Enclaves-Map

A website that shows the map location and provides information about different types of enclaves and exclaves around the world.
You can:
  - filter the types of territories displayed on the map
  - search for a territory by name
  - search for a country to check related territories and find 
  - click on territory markers to learn about them
  - check how many territories are currently on the map

## Project goals

Create a large scalable web application with features such as a search engine, filtering results and an interactive map

## Technical details

The map was created with the leaflet.js library. The colored markers were created with leaflet-color-markers (https://github.com/pointhi/leaflet-color-markers). Everything was written in Vanilla JS. I tried to create clean functions as much as possible and avoid redundancy.

## What are enclaves and exclaves?

An enclave is a territory (or a part of one) that is entirely surrounded by the territory of one other state or entity. Enclaves may also exist within territorial waters. Enclave is sometimes used improperly to denote a territory that is only partly surrounded by another state. The Vatican City and San Marino, both enclaved by Italy, and Lesotho, enclaved by South Africa, are completely enclaved sovereign states. An exclave is a portion of a state or territory geographically separated from the main part by surrounding alien territory (of one or more states). Many exclaves are also enclaves, but are not necessarily so; an exclave can be surrounded by several states. The Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan is an example of an exclave that is not an enclave (bordering Armenia, Turkey and Iran). Semi-enclaves and semi-exclaves are areas that, except for possessing an unsurrounded sea border (a coastline contiguous with international waters), would otherwise be enclaves or exclaves. Enclaves and semi-enclaves can exist as independent states (Monaco, The Gambia and Brunei are semi-enclaves), while exclaves and semi-exclaves proper always constitute just a part of a sovereign state (like the Kaliningrad Oblast).
